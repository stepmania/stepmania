SDL-1.2.7
ffmpeg-0.4.9-pre1
jpeg-6b
libmad-0.1.5.1b
libogg-1.1
libpng-1.2.5
libvorbis-1.0.1
lua-5.0

Directions:
1. Decompress all of those in the Libraries directory.
2. Some of these need to have ./configure run before they will build. I know
that ffmpeg does. Others might as well. ffmpeg's configure needs to be run as
./configure --disable-vhook
3. Build frameworks from those libraries using xcode.
4. Hope I haven't missed anything else...
