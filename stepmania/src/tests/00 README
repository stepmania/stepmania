This file contains test sets.

Currently, all we have is test_audio_readers, which tests the MP3, WAV and Ogg
file readers.

Once I create smaller test inputs, I'll commit them; the current set is about
30 megs.  Until then, if you want to try this, edit the source to point it at
files you have.

This is only compiled in the Unix build environment.

test_vector is for testing VectorHelper against the reference scalar
code. It can be compiled using:
g++ -g -I.. ../archutils/Darwin/VectorHelper.cpp test_vector.cpp -faltivec
You can replace -faltivec with -msse on intel.
