<B> ver 2.2b <SMALL>(01-2002)</SMALL></B>

<B>  Bugs fixed: </B>
	- while a file recompression (smartness level included CZipArchive::zipsmCheckForEff) if the
	AutoFlush feature was enabled, there were redundant bytes added to the archive (thanks to Roman Scherzer)

<B> ver 2.2a <SMALL>(11-2001)</SMALL></B>

<B>  Bugs fixed: </B>
	- aborting extraction of multi-disk archive caused errors (thanks to Sabina Terenzi)


<B> ver 2.2 <SMALL>(10-2001)</SMALL></B> <EM>Time for global changes</EM>

<B> Features added: </B>
	- deleting multiple files from the archive is now way faster - the files are not
	deleted separately as it was so far, but the library creates a map of holes and continuous areas and moves the data to remain in file over the holes; it means that the data is copied
	only once and not for every file to delete.
	- callback functions has been replaced by functional objects to make the code cleaner and to make it possible to pass more information during a callback call (see: CZipArchive::SetCallback). The same application written using the library with callback functions
	and then with functional objects as callbacks (slightly modified) has proven to be circa 15% faster in the latter case (that's why it's in \e features), i.a. because only data that changes is passed to the callback method, method derived from CZipCallback::Callback can be inlined if defined inside the class declaration). Important issues:
		- it affects the following functions parameters:
			- CZipArchive::AddNewFile, 
			- CZipArchive::ExtractFile, 
			- CZipArchive::TestFile,
			- CZipArchive::SetSpanCallback
		- the meaning of the parameters passed to a callback functor is different from that what has so far been passed to the callback functions
		(see CZipCallback)
		- see \ref sectCallb if you're not sure how to use functors
	- added callback feature when deleting files
	- added callback feature when saving central directory
	- added possibility to extract or delete files which filenames match the specified wildcard pattern (see CZipArchive::FindMatches)
	- iterating the central directory elements speeded up (hence all the operations that iterate the central directory were speeded up, especially sorting, multiple adding, extracting, testing)
	- the library now doesn't throw an exception if the platform the archive was created under is not supported, but it tries to distinguish files from directories
	- CZipArchive::Flush can be called now for a disk-spanning archive in creation finalizing it then, and yet allows extracting or testing (see the function description for more)
	- function CZipArchive::CloseNewFile can be called after an exception to allow to repair the archive later
	- adding files with one of CZipArchive::AddNewFile functions can be safely aborted in a non-disk-spanning archive (the added data is removed from the archive)
	- added function CZipException::GetErrorMessage for compatibility with MFC \c CException::GetErrorMessage
	- added parameter \e bForce to CZipArchive::SetTempPath that creates the directory if it doesn't exists
	- the archive created with the library under Windows can be now correctly extracted under Linux and vice versa without the need for setting the system compatibility of the files
	- function CZipArchive::SetIgnoreCRC added to make possible working with the Java <sup><small>TM</small></sup> Archives (jar)
	- function CZipArchive::GetFindFastIndex added
	- function CZipArchive::GetCentralDirInfo added
	- function CZipArchive::GetCentralDirSize added
	- function CZipArchive::GetCurrentDisk added
	- function CZipArchive::IsReadOnly added
	- function CZipFileHeader::CompressionEfficient added
	- function CZipFileHeader::GetCompressionRatio added
	- \c const keywords added to functions
	- TRACE messages are now easier to locate in MSVC++ (double clicking gets you directly to the code now)
	


<B> Changes: </B>
	- if the callback functor's method \c Callback returns \c false,
	a CZipException is thrown with code CZipException::abortedAction or CZipException::abortedSafely;
	- function CZipArchive::DeleteFiles(const CZipStringArray) uses now FindFast array; added \e bFileNameOnly parameter
	- function CZipArchive::GetNoEntries renamed to GetCount (more standard, easier to type and easier to find at the beginning)
	- the encrypted file is not recompressed again if the difference in sizes before and after compression is the
	length of the encryption header
	- function CZipArchive::OpenFile throws exception CZipException::badPassword if the password
	was not set for the encrypted file instead of returning \c false;
	- versioning shortened


<B>  Bugs fixed: </B>
	- CZipStorage::Flush doesn't call now m_pFile->Flush() (it has proven to slow 
	down the archive creation speed significantly) - it is called in different places instead 
	- CZipArchive::TestFile sometimes was not detecting wrong password set
	- filenames in zip are now correctly converted after calling CZipArchive::Flush
	- fixed value of CZipArchive::zipsmCheckForEffInMem; the bug cause the temporary file to be always created in memory
	- ZipPlatform::GetDeviceFreeSpace was not working on Windows with other devices than removable (in spite of what is written in MSDN
	it is sometimes needed to add slash when passing drive name to \c GetDiskFreeSpace and sometimes not).
	I'm not sure if this bug concerned all Windows platforms (it was detected on Windows 2000)
	- crash eliminated when the file modification time could not be retrieved (in case of an impossible value e.g. a year is 28980)
	- Unix attributes corrected
	- CZipArchive::ExtractFile had wrong value passed to the callback function

<B> ver 2.1.1 <SMALL>(10-2001)</SMALL></B>

	<B> Features added: </B>

		- Linux version at the beta stage (thanks to Luiz Rafael Culik for help)
		- smart and efficient compression added to CZipArchive::AddNewFile <BR>
		i.a. optional compression to a temporary file first or to memory, in a disk spanning mode,
		to see whether the file	is smaller after compression and if it is not 
		then add it without the compression	(see also CZipArchive::Smartness)
		- integration of the help system with MSDN made possible (see: \ref sectHelp)
		- adding a file with the user-specified filename in zip (<CODE> CZipArchive::AddNewFile(LPCTSTR , LPCTSTR , int , int , unsigned long ) </CODE>)
		- adding files from memory and extracting files to memory 
		(<CODE>	CZipArchive::AddNewFile(CZipMemFile&, LPCTSTR, int, int, unsigned long) </CODE> and 
		<CODE>CZipArchive::ExtractFile(WORD, CZipMemFile&, DWORD)</CODE>)
		- function CZipArchive::Flush added - increases the safety when working with zip archives (thanks to Brad Kremer for the idea)
		- function CZipArchive::SetCaseSensitivity added (see the function description which functions it affects)
		- function CZipArchive::PredictFileNameInZip added
		- function CZipArchive::PredictExtractedFileName added
		- function CZipArchive::FindFile speeded up again, the case-sensitivity parameter meaning changed, added possibility to find a filename only without a path (see the function description)
		- function CZipArchive::TrimRootPath function improved		
		- function CZipArchive::Close allows now to write the central directory to the archive even after exception, which lets you e.g. repair the archive later
		- obtaining error descriptions (English only) - see CZipException::GetErrorDescription()
		- STL sample application added (a command line archiver which works for both Windows and Linux; located in \e stl/zippie)
		- in TestZipDlg sample application added switch in options to allow an effective compression
		- several minor enhancements 

	<B> Changes: </B>

		- CZipPathComponent functions renamed : <CODE> GetFullFileName -> GetFileName, GetFileName -> GetFileTitle, SetFileName -> SetFileTitle </CODE>
		- file \e __[...].zcfg is created depending on the current configuration when using scripts to copy files (see a note at \ref secCompil)

	<B>  Bugs fixed: </B>

		- when performing a non-case-sensitive search with CZipArchive::FindFile (thanks to Kenny Prole)
		- in CZipString (STL) when using a different locale than English and 
		non-English characters (see \ref stlNotes for info on how to set your locale in the program)
		- CZipStorage::Flush call now m_pFile->Flush() as well (it might have caused a zip creation problems sometimes)

<B> ver 1.6.6 <SMALL>(08-2001)</SMALL></B>
	
<B> Features added: </B>

	- CZipPathComponent understands now a UNC path, so it is possible to
	extract files over a network (other operations over a network were
	already possible)
	- sample application updated to reflect previous (ver 1.6.5) and 
	current changes (necessary prefix added to a UNC path following 
	the Windows File Name Conventions : see \ref q11 "FAQ")


<B> ver 1.6.5 <SMALL>(07-2001)</SMALL></B>
	
<B> Features added: </B>

	- added function CZipArchive::SetRootPath that allows more flexible path 
	manipulations when using CZipArchive::AddNewFile and CZipArchive::ExtractFile
	- ability to set the archive system compatibility to a value different
	than the current system ID with the function CZipArchive::SetSystemCompatibility()

<B>  Bugs fixed: </B>

	- bug which caused not updating the time stamp of an extracted file
	and an exception being thrown, if the file had the read-only attribute set
	(thanks to Arnon Meydav)
	- bugs in conversion of Unix attributes
	- directories inside the archive are now recognized properly by Unix archivers
	if the archive was created for Unix platform


<B> ver 1.6.4 <SMALL>(06-2001)</SMALL></B>
	
	- fixed errors that made impossible using CZipMemFile class and 
	creation of the	archives in memory



<B> ver 1.6.3 <SMALL>(05-2001)</SMALL></B>
	
	- zlib library sources incorporated into ZipArchive library projects
(eliminates most often link errors)


<B> ver 1.6.2 <SMALL>(04-2001)</SMALL></B>

	- ZipPlatform::SetVolLabel() appends now a directory separator to the drive name (lack of it caused errors sometimes)
	- added a simple protection against compiling MFC or STL version without copying the proper files first
	- added several preprocessor directives for Borland compilers


<B> ver 1.6.1 <SMALL>(03-2001)</SMALL></B>

<B> Features added: </B>

	- porting to different platforms made easier
	- possibility to read zip files created on other platforms than Windows
		(correct interpretation of file/directory attributes)
	- documentation generated (using 
	\htmlonly
	<A HREF="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/" target="_blank">Doxygen </A> 
	\endhtmlonly
	)

<B>  Changes: </B>

	- LICENSING CHANGED
