# IA-32 disassembly ruleset module for VirtualDub -- V1.00
# By Avery Lee <phaeron@virtualdub.org>
#
# Based off of:
#	Intel IA-32 Software Developer's Manual, Volume 2
#	AMD 3DNow! Technology manual
#	AMD Extensions to the 3DNow! and MMX Instruction Sets Manual
#
# This version supports MMX, SSE, SSE2, 3DNow!, and 3DNow! Professional
# (Athlon) instruction set extensions.
#
# Known issues:
#
# * LOCK is printed as a separate instruction instead of a prefix.
# * Pentium 4 branch hints aren't printed.
# * Valid disassemblies are produced for some invalid instructions, like
#   CMPXCHG8B EAX.

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Pattern format
#
# All patterns are composed of sequences of the following:
#	[66], [67], [F2], [F3]		Prefix required
#	[!s]						Lack of segment offset required
#	xx							Single byte match (i.e. 0F)
#	xx-xx						Byte match with mask -- mask is determined
#								by XOR of two bytes (10-1E gives mask 0E)
#	*							Any byte
#	ruleset						Apply ruleset at current point
#	:							End of pattern and start of result string
#
# Patterns are matched from top to bottom in a ruleset; if two patterns
# overlap, the first pattern wins.  If no pattern in a ruleset matches, the
# search fails; this causes the parent rule to fail as well, continuing
# the search one level up.  The last ruleset (the main ruleset) must never
# fail.
#
# Masked byte compares (10-1E) need not compare on contiguous bitfields but
# must match the full bitfield.  A 10-15 token doesn't match 10, 11, 12,
# 13, and 14, but only 10, 11, 14, and 15.  To match all six bytes, two
# rules should be used: one with 16-17, and another with 
#
# If a ruleset call is prefixed by !, the submatch begins with the previous
# source byte rather than the current one.  This is used when the register
# field of a modrm byte selects the instruction as well and thus must be
# matched in the parent rule, like some of the shift instruction encodings.
#
# A lone colon is valid and represents a pattern that consumes no bytes and
# always matches.  Needless to say it must be last.  No path may exist from
# the main ruleset that matches only blank rules, since it will cause the
# disassembler to get stuck in a loop, since no bytes are ever consumed.
#
# All byte pattern rules place one byte onto the result stack; all ruleset
# submatch tokens place both the first byte matched and their output string
# onto the stack.  Result stacks are local to each rule, and no rule can
# "see" the stacks of a submatch.

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Result format
#
# Result strings are composed of the following tokens:
#	"xyz"						Literal string
#	$<n>[<bitfield>]<format>	Formatted argument (see below)
#	$ap							Addressing prefix (cs:, etc. or nothing)
#	$p_66, $p_67, $p_f2, $p_f3	Set a prefix flag (no output)
#	$p_cs, $p_ds, etc.			Set addressing prefix (no output)
#
# Formatted arguments take a value from the result stack and output them;
# the argument number ranges from 1 to the number of values on the stack,
# which is at least the number of pattern tokens.  The valid formatting
# types are:
#
#		a/ha/la					8/16/32-bit PC-relative offset
#		o/ho/lo					8/16/32-bit displacement
#		r8						8-bit register (AL, AH, BL, ...)
#		r16						16-bit register (AX, BX, CX, ...)
#		r1632					$r16 if 66 prefix flag is set, else $r32
#		r32						32-bit register (EAX, EBX, ECX, ...)
#		rc						Control register (CR0, CR1, ...)
#		rd						Debug register (DR0, DR1, ...)
#		rf						FPU stack register (st(0), st(1), ...)
#		rm						MMX register (MM0, MM1, ...)
#		rmx						$rx if 66 prefix flag is set, else $rm
#		rs						Segment register (CS, DS, ...)
#		rx						SSE register (XMM0, XMM1, ...)
#		s						string
#		x/hx/lx					8/16/32-bit hex constant
#
# Format arguments can also contain by a bitfield descriptor of the form
# [a-b], where a is the LSB and b is the MSB of the bitfield to extract.
# This is often used for modrm encodings to extract the register
# argument, i.e. $2[3-5]r8.
#
# Some of the format types will attempt a symbol lookup, and print symbol
# and offset as well if there is a match.  This includes $a, $ha, $la,
# $lo, and $lx.
#
# If a result string produces no output, the disassembler loops back again
# and reapplies the main ruleset, keeping the current state.  This is used
# to handle prefixes without needlessly recursing and recopying output
# strings.
