Conditions
--------------

SongTitle:
enter the name of a song title. be aware -- if you have multiples of a song with the
same name then you may want to enter more information like the artist and even song
foot ratings.

Example-
SongTitle:Paranoia Survivor Max
this will show the BGA only if PSM is available.



SongArtist:
enter the name of an artist, any song which matches the artist name will display the bga.

Example-
SongArtist:Naoki
all songs where  the artist is Naoki will show the BGA



Clear:
clear will show the bga under one of four conditions:
* true - this will show if the song was cleared
* false - this will show if the song was failed
* fullcombo - this will show if the song was full comboed
* brokencombo - this will show if the song was cleared but not fullcomboed

Example-
Clear:fullcombo
this will only show if one of the players fullcomboed the song.



ModDisallow:
moddisallow will ensure that the bga is NOT displayed if any of the players
have the option. At the time of writing (11/feb/2004) not all mods have been
supported, but certainly things like little are not available (ideal if you
want somebody to get a rewarding bga for clearing a hard song in heavy, but dont
want them getting it via using a mod like little).
You may specify multiple mods by seperating them with commas (,)

Example-
ModDisallow:little,nojumps,noholds 
the bga will only show provided little, nojumps and noholds are not selected by any
player.



Grade:
grade will compare a players grade with their current grade if they have one
so you could have it display a BGA if a player AAA'd a track. You may seperate
grades via commas (,) which will indicate a grade history with the latest stage
being at the end of the list.

Example-
Grade:AAA,AAA,AAA
the above will show the bga only if the player has passed at least 3 stages and
one of the players got a AAA on each stage.




SongMonth:
the bga will only display if the current month matches. Months range from 0-11 with 
0 being janurary and 11 being december. 

Example-
SongMonth:2
the bga will only appear if its march.




SongDay:
the bga will only appear on a day in the month

Example-
SongDay:10
the bga only appears if it is the 10th day in the month.



Style:
the bga will only appear if the specified style is available. you can specify multiple
style by seperating them with commas (,)

Example-
Style:double,single
this will display the BGA only if the style is in double or single.




SongRating:
the bga will only show if one of the players is in a difficulty matching that specified
you may specify multiple ratings by seperating them with a comma (,)

Example-
SongRating:heavy,light
this will show the bga only if a player played heavy or light notes.



SongDifficulty:
if a player was playing a song with a footrating specified then the bg will display
you can seperate difficulties with commas (,) you can specify ranges like the following:
1-3 this is the same as writing 1,2,3 also you may check for ratings and greater for 
example: 9+ will check for all catastrophic songs.

Example-
SongDifficulty:SongDifficulty:1-3,5,9+
this will show the bga if the songs difficulty is 1,2,3,5,9(and onwards)


------------------
Overriding
------------------
If there are several bga's listed in a file, and the conditons specified are met
for more than one bga, the one listed nearest to the end of the file will have priority.
