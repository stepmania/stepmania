This document describes the implementation of TimingData in StepMania, as of
shortly after version 5.0 beta 1a.


== What is TimingData? ==

TimingData refers to the information in a chart (a "Steps") or a song which
maps real time to beats and vice versa.  This includes all BPMs and the
initial offset, as well as time gimmicks like stops, warps, and delays.  The
TimingData object itself only has a few members:
* the name of the file that specified the data (for display only)
* the beat 0 offset
* a vector of TimingSegments for each type (BPM, warp, label, etc.)

Each TimingSegment specifies a starting point in the chart, as well as any
parameters which are specific to that segment type.  For a list of the
different types of TimingSegments, see TimingSegments.h.


== Split Timing ==

TimingData is primarily used for charts and songs, to specify the BPM and
offset and to implement gimmicks, as well as to synchronize effects with
background music.  (It also provides features such as labels and time
signatures which can be useful when editing a chart.)

Prior to StepMania 5, each song had a single TimingData structure which was
then used by all of the charts associated with that song.  StepMania 5
introduces a feature known as Split Timing, wherein a chart can have
individual TimingData ("Steps Timing") which is independent of the song's
TimingData ("Song Timing").  This allows for Pump-style gimmicks which can
differ between difficulties on the same song.


== Implementation ==

In the code, Song Timing is contained in the m_SongTiming field of a Song
object.  Song Timing is used by default for any chart which does not specify
its own timing information.

If a chart has its own timing information, this is contained in the m_Timing
field of the Steps object.  If the chart does not have separate timing
information, the m_Timing structure will be empty (i.e. none of the vectors
will contain any TimingSegments).  The TimingData::empty() function provides a
simply way to determine this.

The most common way to get the TimingData for a chart is to use the
GetTimingData() function of the Steps object.  This function will perform the
appropriate fallback to Song Timing if the chart's timing is empty.  If, as in
the editor or sync implementations, it is necessary to access the Steps Timing
or Song Timing individually, the corresponding fields can be used instead.

=== Editing ===

The editor has a "timing mode" setting which can be toggled between Song
Timing and Steps Timing (in the code, GAMESTATE->m_bIsUsingStepTiming).  This
mode determines which set of TimingData will be updated when changes are made
with hotkeys or the Timing menu.  It defaults to Steps Timing if the chart
being loaded has individual TimingData, and Song Timing otherwise.
Considering that we also want this to behave according to whether a chart has
individual timing, there are four possibilities when making a change:

1. Song Timing mode, chart DOES NOT HAVE individual timings: changes will be
   made to the Song Timing, and the chart will not have individual timings
   added to it.  Because of this, the changes to Song Timing will "show
   through" to this chart.
2. Song Timing mode, chart HAS individual timings: changes will be made to the
   Song Timing only.  The timings in the chart will be left untouched.  Because
   of this, the changes to Song Timing will not affect this chart.
3. Steps Timing mode, chart HAS individual timings: changes will be made to the
   Steps Timing only and will affect only this chart.
4. Steps Timing mode, chart DOES NOT HAVE individual timings: first, the Song
   Timing will be copied into this chart.  The changes are then made to the
   Steps Timing only and will affect only this chart.

Case #4 describes how Steps Timing is added to a chart: simply select Steps
Timing mode and start making changes.  To remove Steps Timing, use the
corresponding item in the Timing menu.


== File formats ==

A quick note is in order about Split Timing support in the different file
formats supported by StepMania:

* SSC files support Split Timing natively.  Timing tags such as #BPMS in the
  file header apply to the song, whereas the same tags inside a #NOTEDATA
  section apply only to the current chart.
* SM files do not support Split Timing, since there is no way to specify
  individual timing for a chart.
* SMA files support Split Timing in a similar fashion to SSC files.
* The KSF and BMS formats use one file for each chart, and therefore already
  have per-chart timing information.  When reading these formats, *every
  chart* has Steps Timing.
* The DWI format does not support Split Timing, so Steps Timing is not written
  to DWI files.
