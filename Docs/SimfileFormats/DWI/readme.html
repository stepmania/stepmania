<P><FONT size="+1"><B>1. DISCLAIMER AND TERMS OF USE</B></font></P>

<P>This program is provided for free, as-is.  Although it has been tested on multiple systems for compatability and reliability, you run this program at your own risk.  I cannot be held responsible if the program causes file loss or other problems.</P>

<P>THIS PROGRAM IS *NOT* FOR SALE!!!  IT SHOULD NEVER BE BUNDLED WITH ANY OTHER FILES (MUSIC OR STEP FILES) ON ANY MEDIA, INCLUDING (BUT NOT LIMITED TO) CD's, DVD's, DISKS OR OTHER MEDIA.</P>

<P>DWI is <b>Donation-Ware</b>.  Although you are not required to donate, it would be greatly appreciated if you enjoy the program that you contribute something towards the developers.</P>

<P>This program simulates a popular arcade and home video game.  It was written to allow myself the ability to play songs from the games without having to switch CDs in my Playstation or Dreamcast, and also affords the ability to add new songs not currently available.  It also allows for playing older songs with new play modes, such as downward-scrolling arrows.  This program is being released to the public in the hopes that others would find it useful in the same manner.</P>

<P>As such, this program REQUIRES responsibility on the part of the end-user (ie. YOU) to use the program LEGALLY.  You should *ONLY* play songs where you:<DIR>

<TABLE cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2>
<TR><TD align=right>a)&nbsp;</TD><TD> Own the game from which that music comes from.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD align=right>or b)&nbsp;</TD><TD> Own the soundtrack CD from which the music comes from.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD align=right>or c)&nbsp;</TD><TD> Legally own rights to the music being used (ie. other CDs, etc.)</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</DIR></P>

<P>I own all the available soundtracks and videogames for the music I own, and respectfully ask that you support the games and purchase them.  Thank you.</P>

<PRE>
v2.50.00 - August 14, 2003.
            - NEW: Addition of WAVE, BRAKE, and 0.25x modifiers.
            - BUGFIX: Stage numbers and various other numbers are coloured again.
				- BUGFIX: Bonus stages now default to Heavy/Maniac again.
            - OTHER: Various other bugs I can't remember that have been fixed.
				
</PRE>

<P><a name="3"></a><FONT size="+1"><B>3. USING AND CONFIGURING DWI</B></font></P>

<P><B>BASIC OPERATION</B></P>

<P>When you first run DWI, you will receive a warning screen about responsible use of the program.  This warning screen will appear *EVERY* time the program detects new songs.</P>

<P>DWI uses step-files with the extension ".DWI".  These files go in their own folder along with their associated background and banner images.  Optionally the music file can go in the same folder also.</P>

<P>DWI supports multiple collections of songs, so you can organise your songs as you see fit.  To do this, just create different sub-directories in the "Songs" folder.</P>

<P>eg. For a song with a step-file of "abc.dwi", put into a collection called "My Songs", your directory structure should look like this:<PRE>
     &lt;INSTALL directory&gt;
        + Songs
           + My Songs
              + abc
                 + abc-banner.png   (any name, the program will detect that it's a banner)
                 + abc-bg.png       (any name, the program will detect that it's a background)
                 + abc.dwi          (any name)
                 + (abc.mp3/wav)    (optional - otherwise FILE: tag is used).
                 + (abc.lrc)        (optional - should have same base as DWI file).
</PRE>
</DIR></P>

<P>So, in each "song folder", there should be two image files (background and banner), the DWI file, and optionally the music file in MP3 or WAV format.</P>

<P><B>Song Sorting</B></P>

<P>When you are at the song select screen, simply press up or down to change the current collection you are in.  Songs are organized alphabetically within each collection, and collections are organized alphabetically also.</P>

<P>Another option is to sort your music by genre.  To activate this, go to "Options Menu", then "System Menu", and change the sort method to "GENRE" *.  This requires your DWI files to have a tag defining the genre to put the music into (see DWI format, below).  Multiple genres can be given (separated by a comma), to make the same song appear in different collections.  At the song select screen, press up or down to change the genre.</P>

<P>You can also press Up-Left to change the sort method.  This cycles through:<UL>
<LI> Folder/Genre (default)
<LI> Folder/Genre, Separated
<LI> All Music (by title)
<LI> All Music (by artist)
<LI> BPM.
   <LI> Player's Best (top 64)
</UL></P>

<P><B>Selecting Song Modifiers</B></P>

<P>At the song-select screen, press the "Select" button/key, and use the arrows to change options.  When done, press "Select" again.  Alternatively, you can hold down "Start" when selecting a song and you will be taken to a 
screen where you can set your options.</P>

<P><B>Controller Configuration</B></P>

<P>To change the inputs, simply go to the Options Menu from the main screen and goto "Keyboard Configuration" or "Gamepad Configuration".  Choose to configure either Player 1 or Player 2's inputs and you will be prompted to press each key, joystick button or dancepad square in turn.  You cannot choose an input that is currently in use.  To skip joystick buttons, press the "TAB" key.</P>

<P>When done, select "Return" to make the change take effect.</P>

<P><B>Gameplay Settings</B></P>

<P>Gameplay settings such as difficulty level, danger display, and end-of-game settings are selected from the Gameplay Configuration menu from the Options screen.  These changes take effect immediately.</P>

<P><B>Extra Stages</B></P>

<P>If you AA a Heavy or Challenge mode song on the last stage and have Extra Stages enabled in the Game Options, you can play another song.  The song(s) you can choose from are either generated randomly (3 for Extra Stage #1, one for Extra Stage #2), or can be defined in a CRS file.</P>

<P><B>Sound Configuration</B></P>

<P>The default sound settings for DWI are 44Khz, Stereo, 16-bit samples.  However, you may want to lower these
settings on slower computers.</P>

<SMALL><B>* NB: You must exit DWI and start it again for this change to take effect.</B></SMALL>

<P><B>Sound effects</B></P>

<P>Sound effects are all in the "Sounds" directory.  You can add or remove files to most directories, and the program will use the existing files during gameplay.  However, files in the root of the sound-set directory and those in the "attract" and "combo" directories must be the same name in order for the program to find them and play them appropriately.</P>

<P><a name="clo"></a><B>Command-line options</B></P>

<P>You can run DWI with various command line options to configure some values.  (Please read the FAQ for details
on how to start the program with command line options).  These options are available:</P>

<P align=center><DIR><TABLE cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2>

</TABLE></DIR></P>

<P>You can limit paging to virtual memory during gameplay (which can cause skips as Windows decides to write or retrieve data from disk) using these flags:</P>

Using this command line argument will tell DWI to not try to display the image and instead write "X Lives" in its place, which seemed to make it work.

<P>Starts testing the .dwi file found in \songs\development\mynewsong, in SINGLE mode, with MANIAC-level steps.  Player 2's controls are used, and the song's speed is set to '4'.  Arrows are displayed as though the "x2" modifier was active.  The song starts at the 1-minute mark.</P>

<P><B>Setting Skins</B></P>

<P>Create different sub-directories within the "Skins" folder  for each skin you wish to use.  So, for example:
<PRE>
     &lt;INSTALL directory&gt;
        + Skins
            + Default  (leave as-is)
            + Skin A
            + Skin B
            + ...         </PRE></P>

<P>The filenames for each skin should be the same as in the default directory.  If an image isn't found, the default is used.  This way you can create skins that are relatively simple, or very elaborate ones.  And you don't need to delete any of the original files. ;)  There is a limit of 64 skins.</P>

<P>Changes will take effect when you leave the Skin Selection screen.</P>

<P>I do ask, however, that you keep the title of the program as "Dance With Intensity".  Thank you. :)</P>

<P><B>Setting Announcer and Sound Effects</B></P>

<P>Similar to skins, just create new directories in the 'Sounds' folder for each sound set you wish to use.  So, for example:
<PRE>
     &lt;INSTALL directory&gt;
        + Sounds
            + Default   (leave as-is)
            + Jack
            + Jill
            + ...         </PRE></P>

<P>The tree structure for each set should be the same as is used for the "Default" directory.  For example:
<PRE>    + Jill
        + attract    - files should be named attract-00.wav, attract-01.wav, attract-02.wav
        |              (these are the sounds used on the title screen)
        + combo      - files should be named combo-00.wav and combo-01.wav
        |              ("100 Combo" and "Combo stopped")
        + danger     - a set of files played when power level at danger or zero.
        + eval
        |   + A
        |   + B      - sets of files to play at the evaluation screen based on grade
        |   + ...   
        + good       - a set of files played when power level in the 'good' range
        + great      - "                                           " 'great' range
        + over
        |   + fail   - files played at game over screen (failure)
        |   + pass   - "                              " (cleared all stages)
        + select
        |   + new    - files played when #STATUS:NEW; is set in DWI file and song is selected
        |   + song   - files played when a song is selected
        + start
        +   + go     - files played at "Here we go!" screen.
        +   + ready  - files played at "Ready?" screen.
        + warning    - a set of files played when the power gauge is in the 'warning' range.</PRE></P>

<P>There should not be more than 64 sound effects in a single subdirectory.  There is a limit of 64 sets.  Changes will take effect once you leave the Announcer/Sound Select screen.  Please keep the title sound effect (attract-00.wav) as "Dance With Intensity".</P>

<P><B>Folder- and Genre- Specific Banners</B></P>
<P>You can make DWI display a special banner for each folder when it is highlighted on the Song-Select Screen.  To do this, simply put a standard (horizontal) banner with the same name as the folder in the 'Songs' folder.  (eg. a banner for 'Default Songs' would be ".\Songs\Default Songs.png").</P>

<P>If you have sorting by Genre on, you can have special banners for each Genre by putting banners in PNG format with the same name as the Genre referenced into ".\Genres".  (eg. "Pop Music.png").</P>

<P>Folder-Specific Banners can also be made for Courses too.  Just put a PNG file with the same name as the subfolder the CRS files are in, in the "Courses" directory.</P>

<P><B>AVI Movie Support</B></P>
<P>AVI movies can be played in the background while you play.  See the "<a href="#background">Background Animation</a>" section below for more details on how this is set up.  From the System Menu, you can tell DWI whether to not play AVI files at all, or set the quality level from 1 (worst) to 10 (full).  The default is 5.  Changing this value could affect your framerate, so play with the values to determine what works best for your system.</P>

<P>Random animations are picked from the ./Movies/Random folder and played in the background of songs without a defined background script if enabled in the System Options menu.  This folder can be changed by a flag in the DWI file also, enabling themes.</P>

<P><B>Sonique Visualizations (SVP) Support</B></P>
<P>Sonique visualizations can be played in the background while you play.  See the "<a href="#background">Background Animation</a>" section below for more details on how this is set up.  From the System Menu, you can tell DWI whether to use them at all, or set the quality level from 1 (worst) to 10 (full).  The default is 5.  Changing this value could affect your framerate, so play with the values to determine what works best for your system.</P>

<P>Random visualizations are picked from the ./Vis folder and played in the background of songs without a defined background script if enabled in the System Options menu.  Their behavior can often be changed by editing the 'vis.ini' file that is created after they are used in DWI, similar to in Sonique.</P>

<P><A name='profiles'><B>User Profiles</B></a></P>
<P>DWI2.40 introduced 'user profiles' - a way that multiple users can play DWI on the same machine and keep their own individual records.  Setting up a new profile is easy - simply create a new subdirectory in the "Profiles" directory with the name of the user (15 characters or less), and inside that folder, put a 64x64 PNG file called 'user.png' to represent you in the game.  Look at the 'Profiles/Sample User' folder for an example.</P>

<P>When you use a profile, DWI will create an individual records file and profile information file in the same directory that keeps track of your individual achievements.</P>

<P>When you get a high score, it will be saved to your own profile's records ("New Personal Best"), and, if you beat the overall high score, it will also be saved to the system records ("It's a New Record!"), with your username registered with it.</P>

<P>Using a user-profile also lets you track some other statistics, such as overall high scores and combos for each mode.  It will also store the last-used modifiers you used (eg. 2x speed modifier, Reverse) between sessions, so you don't have to set it again each time you start a new game.</P>

<P><SMALL><I>This option can be disabled in the Game Options Menu if you prefer.</I></SMALL></P>

<a name="4"></a><FONT size="+1"><B>4. DWI FILE FORMAT</B></font>

<P><B>Steps</B></P>

<P>DWI uses step-files that are similar to the ".MSD" file format.  However, there are new additions and some tags are treated slightly differently, so the extension was changed to avoid confusion.  DWI files with these new additions will not work properly in other simulators.</P>

<P>Step-patterns are defined in the same way as .MSD files - use the numeric keypad as a reference for most patterns:
<PRE>
  7=U+L     8=U      9=U+R

  4=L                6=R

  1=D+L     2=D      3=D+R

    (U+D = A and L+R = B)
</PRE></P>

<P>A '0' indicates no step.  Each character defaults to one 1/8 of a beat.  Surround a series of characters with the following brackets to change the rate at which the steps come:
<PRE>
   (...)  = 1/16 steps
   [...]  = 1/24 steps
   {...}  = 1/64 steps
   `...'  = 1/192 steps</PRE></P>

<P>6-panel (Solo) mode uses additional characters:
<PRE>
   -\---- = C
   ----/- = D

   L\---- = E
   -\D--- = F
   -\-U-- = G
   -\---R = H

   L---/- = I
   --D-/- = J
   ---U/- = K
   ----/R = L

   -\--/- = M</PRE></P>

<P>To do more than 2 panels at a time, you can join codes together with the "&lt;..&gt;" object, and they will all count as the same beat.  So, to do a jump that involves Left, Right, Up-Left, and Up-Right, you could do:
<PRE>
   -\--/- = M
   L----R = B
   ======
   L\--/R = &lt;MB&gt;  (or &lt;LE&gt;, &lt;IH&gt;, &lt;46M&gt;, etc.)</PRE></P>

<P>MSD files from other simulators will work with DWI, with a change in the 'GAP' value being the only change usually necessary.  DWI calculates the 'GAP' value differently than other simulators that use the MSD format.</P>

<P>DWI does not support the BMS file format.  There is a utility available that can convert any BMS file into DWI format.  Each song only requires one DWI file for all of its steps, so if you are converting BMS files please remember that all the different difficulties of step patterns will be contained in the same DWI file.</P>

<P><B>Hold Arrows</B></P>

<P>In the DWI file format a hold arrow is signified with the <B><TT>!</TT></B> symbol.  The string <B><TT>8!8</TT></B> will begin an 'up' hold arrow, and the arrow will be released the next time the program encounters an 'up' arrow: by itself or combined with another arrow (7, 8, 9, A, etc.)  The characters <B><TT>7!4</TT></B>  would show both 'up' and 'left' arrows but only the left arrow would be held.  The format could best be described as "<B><TT>show!hold</TT></B>".</P>

<P>DWI allows for background animations using a special script within the step-file.  A script consists of static images, animated images, and/or an AVI movie.  Using the script, you can create a variety of layered effects.  A sample animation is described below:
<PRE>

<P>Following the effect definition, comes the actual animation script.  This is a sequence of characters in a similar way as the step-patterns are given - each character normally is 1/8 of a beat, though brackets can be used to change the time-values.  In this way, background animations can be syched to the steps.  It is suggested that the steps for "SINGLE:BASIC" are copied to after the "SCRIPT:" tag, and then the effects be set.  In this way one knows that the script will match the same length of the music.</P>

<P>The animations take effect as that point in the song is reached.  Multiple effects can occur at the same time if they are separated with a comma.  A period (.) means no new effect should take place at that point.  A zero (0) turns off all effects and returns the background to the original graphic.</P>

<P>CRS files are similar to DWI files in structure.  The file defines the basic details about the course, such as  its name and which songs should be played.  Currently these tags are supported:</P>

<P><B>Required tags:</B></P>

<P><DIR><TABLE cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2>

<PRE>    <B>PLAYER'S BEST/WORST STAGE:</B>
    #SONG:BESTx:[BASIC|ANOTHER|MANAIC|SMANIAC];
    #SONG:WORSTx:[BASIC|ANOTHER|MANAIC|SMANIAC];
    - choose a song with the given index 'x'.  So <TT>BEST1</TT> is the most popular
      song, and <TT>WORST5</TT> is the 5th least popular song.  If the given 
      difficulty is not available, DWI will choose the next closest difficulty.
      Songs that are equally popular will be put in random order.

    <B>RANDOM STAGE:</B>
    #SONG:*:[a]|[a..b];
    - choose a random song, with a difficulty rating equal to or between 'a' and 'b'.
    - if only 'a' is given, 'b' is assumed to be the same as 'a'.

    #SONG:*:[BASIC|ANOTHER|MANIAC|SMANAIC];
    - choose a random song with a given difficulty level.

    #SONG:folder\*:[a]|[a..b]|[BASIC|ANOTHER|MANIAC|SMANIAC];
    - choose a random song from a given folder.
                   
    <B>DEFINED STAGE:</B>
    #SONG:&lt;FOLDER&gt;\&lt;SONG TITLE&gt;:&lt;DIFFICULTY&gt;;
    - will use a song from &lt;FOLDER&gt; with the given title.
      So to play a song called "My Song", which is in 
      './Songs/Default/mysong/mysong.dwi', on MANIAC, 
      you would say:

      #SONG:Default\My Song:MANIAC;</PRE></P>

<P><B><SMALL>NB: Either the TITLE or folder the DWI file is in can be used.</SMALL></B></P>

<P>In addition, modifiers can be defined for each song by adding a list of comma-separated values to the end of the #SONG line.  These modifiers are the same as listed above, plus
<PRE>
     <B>xRANDOM</B>   - where 'x' is the number of random effects to apply.
                 'x' can be 1 to 7.
     <B>AWARDx</B>    - where 'x' is the number of lives to award after 
                 finishing the stage.
</PRE></P>
<P>So to play "My Song", Maniac, with 2.0x, Left, Hidden, and with one random effect, use:<BR>

<P><PRE>v2.49.00 - May 22, 2003.
            - NEW: Addition of "Player's Best" and "Player's Worst" to CRS file format.
            - NEW: Expanded functionality of random song selection in CRS files.  You can now
              choose a random song by difficulty (instead of just foot ratings), and also select a 
              random song in a particular folder
            - NEW: Courses are now arranged in subfolders, allowing for different groupings of 
              courses.  One set could be for nonstop, others for challenge; or you can divide the 
              courses up by mix or genre, etc.  You can also give each folder its own banner, like
              in the song select interface.
                 NOTE: You will have to move your existing courses into subfolders for them to 
                 be recognized!
            - NEW: #DISPLAYBPM:[xxx..xxx]|[xxx]|[*]; added, to force a certain display type on 
              song select screen.
            - NEW: For users with old videocards that can't display semi-transparent images, you 
              can now turn off the dithering effect that DWI uses if you like.  Use the 
              '/dither:0' command line argument.
            - Tweaks to how #RANDFOLDER:...; behaves, plus program now searches folder DWI file 
              is in for a "Movies" sub-folder, or AVIs in the same folder first before using the 
              default /Movies/Random folder.
            - Tweaks to banner display on Evaluation screen (for when song/course had no banner)
            - Tweaks to record-display for courses.
            - Tweak to beat-display in-game and in developers mode, so numbers won't 'jiggle'.
            - BUGFIX: 'tiled images' on song-select screen (BPM, stage #, difficulty) and during 
              gameplay on some old videocards has been fixed.  You should probably consider 
              upgrading to a better card though anyway. ;^)
            - BUGFIX: Can now have up to 512 courses, instead of 64.  Oops. ;)
            - BUGFIX: "combo continuing" playing on every step past 9999 combo.  BTW, I hate you. ;)
            - BUGFIX: Game doesn't crash on entering course-select screen after you've added new 
              CRS files.
            - OTHER: Other bugfixes and tweaks that I can't begin to remember. :P

v2.41.00 - February 15, 2003.
            - CHANGE: Drawing of text made more efficient and slightly more readable, through better 
              drawing of drop-shadows.
            - CHANGE: textures for SVP plug-ins to draw to now adjusted to nearest multiple of 2, as I 
              suspect some assume it's supposed to be like that for efficiency reasons, and otherwise 
              might cause problems overrunning memory.
            - BUGFIX: DWI2.log file now created properly again.  (d'oh!!!)
            - BUGFIX: problem drawing certain images in 32bpp SDL mode fixed (eg. BPM display, star-wipe)
            - BUGFIX: extra 'N/A" box no longer appears in Solo mode "Select Profile" if started with P1.
            - BUGFIX: Better freeing of music samples after gameplay, credits, and on song-select screen.

v2.40.00 - February 2, 2003.
            - NEW: Addition of "User Profiles", a system to keep user-specific records and high 
              scores similar to the 'name entry' system from DWI1, but with more features.  Individual
              users can tailor their own icon and (if directories are the same across systems) take 
              their records with them between machines.  Now tracks personal high scores and overall
              high scores, all viewable in the Records screen. (Can be disabled in Options menu if you
              prefer not to use it).
            - NEW: Arrow set for DWI completely redone to feature true colour-cycling arrows like the
              arcade.  Also, arrows are drawn in last-to-first order now instead of first-to-last.
              (NB: Thanks to uKER for the help creating the new arrow set).
            - NEW: You can pause the game with the "Pause/Break" key.  However, like autoplay, high
              score will not be saved.
            - CHANGE: Folder-specific banners treated differently - now DWI looks for a PNG file with 
              the same name as the sub-folder, in the base "Songs" folder.  Should be easier to 
              manage the banners all in one folder now.
            - some freeze arrow behavior tweaked.
            - shading on song-select wheel made less dark.
            - more details on LRC file support added to this file.
            - style icon colours in default skin fixed (they were reversed).
            - if you pass a song reasonably well, you'll get that cheer as the 'Cleared' text appears.
            - BUGFIX: strange wrapping in View Records/Nonstop mode for some songs with two lines fixed.
            - BUGFIX: Song titles and artist names with special characters on Nonstop mode now display
              correctly
            - BUGFIX: Timing in Developer mode after adjusting GAP fixed.  Actually tested it this time. ;)
            - BUGFIX: Realigning the word 'Test' in developer mode.
            - BUGFIX: /startat in developer mode is more accurrate.
            - BUGFIX: Bonus CRS files don't 'skip' songs that are next to each other in the songlist.
            - VARIOUS: other small tweaks I can't remember. ;)

v2.30.01 - January 3, 2003.
            - AVI and SVP decoding optimized slightly to reduce load on main game function.
            - flag added to turn off shading on song select wheel, if desired.
            - BUGFIX: "Game Over" back in on failing in regular mode.  Oops.
            - BUGFIX: "NEW!" status works.  Expires after 2 weeks now.  May require songlist reset.
            - BUGFIX: animation thread closes properly between stages.
            - BUGFIX: steps are judged better again.  Oops x 2.

v2.30.00 - January 1, 2003.
            - NEW: Implemented Sonique Visualization Plugins (SVP) for background animations.

            - NEW: Multiple colours on same line of lyrics possible.

            - Sort by BPM now much faster.
            - Paths in Background Scripts can now have spaces (use quotes around path).
            - Addition to Background Script commands to use Visualizations (on Layer 0).
            - Long song names with special characters now wrap.
            - Options Screens reorganized to group some things better.
            - Adjustments to GAP in Development mode handled properly if changed in DWI file.
            - Ability to change method for drawing movies/etc. to older method (slower, but good
              for old videocards that just give solid-colour images instead now).
            - CRS files can take either title or directory now.
            - Stage number/display now graphical, and colours can be assigned in skin CFG file.
            - "TAB" can be used in song-titles to force line-wrap.
            - Font updated to include missing '~' character.
            - Song select wheel now has some extra shading.
            - Support for semi-transparant images on older videocards improved by addition of 
              pattern dithering instead of simply "off" or "on".
            - BUGFIX: Missing '0's in scores during gameplay.
            - BUGFIX: Rounding of scores to proper multiples of 10000000 on some processors.
            - BUGFIX: Early "GOOD" judgement on a freeze arrow + jump combination fixed.
            - BUGFIX: "New" tag treated properly again.
            - BUGFIX: Random AVI search assumed any file was an AVI, without checking extension.
            - BUGFIX: Skin CFG file with Hex values in uppercase read properly now.

            - Songlist.html only written if files added/updated/deleted

v2.20.00 - November 20, 2002.
            - NEW: "Final Tally" screen added if number of stages not set to "Unlimited".
            - NEW: Timer added to developer mode.

v2.10.00 - November 12, 2002.
            - NEW: Songlist rebuild is now automatic and time for incremental updates has been
                   dramatically reduced, as the whole song database does not get rebuilt from 
                   scratch each time now.  (NB: Special thanks to uKER for his code that 
                   implements this).
            - NEW: Extra stages implemented - extra stages can be defined in CRS files, or 
                   random songs are chosen automatically.
            - NEW: Extra character support in song titles, course titles, and artist names
                   now possible with new tags to DWI format.

            - selecting difficulty on song-select screen requires discrete button presses, so
              it won't cycle accidentally.
            - BUGFIX: 'empty' space below song-names on Course selection screen corrected.
            - BUGFIX: Various graphical glitches corrected.

v2.01.10 - August 12, 2002.
            - '/showsm' will show SMANIAC-only songs on the select screen, otherwise they're hidden
            - All keys now read using DirectInput (or SDL) instead of using old Windows interfaces.  So 
              problems with Escape and F1..F12 should be fixed now.
            - BUGFIX: doubling of time in Nonstop Versus mode fixed
            - BUGFIX: lives added properly now in Nonstop Doubles and Solo modes.
            - BUGFIX: after rebuilding songlist, starting in Single mode should behave now.

            - NEW: Press up-left ("sort") button on Results screen to switch to percentage-display
            - NEW: Credits screen finally added.  Thanks to all who have helped. :)
            - NEW: Support for more than two panels at a time in a jump.  (DWI specification tweaked slightly)
            - NEW: '/v5hack' command-line argument for some strange Voodoo card drivers.  Might
                   fix problems on Voodoo cards if you can't get it working right.
            - NEW: Ability to specify number of lives added after each stage in Nonstop mode.  Also changed
                   default behavior to give back lives in relation to difficulty of song just played.
            - Groove radar values calculated better; now Chaos gives a better value, and all values are in 
              relation to the length of the song now (so extended-length songs don't give too-large values).
            - Songs with only SMANIAC steps are now selectable in regular song-select screen.
            - If current difficulty selected is 'bumped' when moving to a song that doesn't have that set of 
              steps, it'll go back to that setting when the next song that does is selected.
            - Wrapping of song-titles tweaked to wrap on " -", not just "-".
            - Power bar 'sliding' behavior tweaked.
            - In Options Menu, currently-selected item is remembered when returning from sub-menus.
            - Maximum number of songs allowed upped to 2048.
            - BUGFIX: going to course-select screen after rebuilding songlist should work correctly now.
            - BUGFIX: starting a song with 'start' on a gamepad won't take you to the options screen unless
                      you hold it now.
            - BUGFIX: 'beat' counter behavior fixed for when a BPM-pause/freeze occurs.
            - BUGFIX: animations should behave now when speed is altered.

v2.00.52 - I released the DirectInput implementation too soon, sorry.  This should solve the
           issues with DX mode in some operating systems, and SDL mode.

v2.00.5 - August 2, 2002.
          - I now have WindowsXP... yay... so now I can test DWI in it...
          - 'white flashes' during video playback fixed.
          - grading system (rounding) bug fixed... (I think...).
          - keyboard input now uses DirectInput for most things, instead of Windows functions - 
            should hopefully be faster and avoid some lag problems some have been experiencing.
          - second set of keyboard inputs can be configured now.
          - can't change sort method after choosing "ROULETTE" anymore.

v2.00.3 - July 25, 2002.
          - fixes a number of graphical problems related to songs with positive GAP values.
          - groove radar calculations now a bit more tolerant of mistakes in files.
          - .75x and .5x modifiers corrected in Options screen.
          - Stealth now selectable through both methods.
          - New freeze arrow 'flash' animation as earlier version was getting mixed reviews. ;)
          - fixed Roulette when "Sort by Genre" is used.
          - Difficulty tweaked slightly.
          - Failure of stage behaves properly again.

          - IMPORTANT - I meant to do this with the first release of 2.00, but forgot -
            DWI2's configuration is stored in 'dwi2.cfg', 'dwi2.sng', 'dwi2.rec', etc.
            IF YOU HAVE BEEN RUNNING v2.00, PLEASE RENAME 'dance.*' 'dwi2.*'.
            Sorry for the inconvenience.

v2.00.0 - July 22, 2002.
          - Completely overhauled DWI's interface.  The 'brushed metal' look is out in favor
            of a new, more colourful design
          - New, more readable and stylish font
          - optional timer on gameplay screens to hurry things up
          - hold 'START' when selecting a song to open up a new 'select options' screen
            ('SELECT' will still let you change options as before also).
          - DWI2 has removed old interfaces that I feel are outdated and in the process makes 
            it much easier to update.  At the same time, the base skin has been updated 
            considerably. (NB: old skins will not be recognized, sorry...)
          - Nonstop Mode now keeps track of time, percent, etc.
          - MAX2 scoring and grading system
          - Smooth animations for judgements, combo display
          - New animation for song start/end
          - Groove Radar implemented (values calculated when Songlist is rebuilt)
          - Roulette added to song-select screen
          - 5th/MAX-style power bars and gameplay interfaces, freeze arrows, etc.
          - completely redone evaluation screen
          - usernames taken out - they were a pain to put in anyway
          - Song banners now used on song-select screen if available.  Can be horizontal or
            old diagonal-style (backgrounds used as before if no banner found)
          - Records screen now keeps track of Nonstop records too
          - new option '/fps:xx' lets you set a maximum framerate (20..100); saves processor 
            time for other applications if you've got a fast machine
          - multiple bugs fixed.

SPECIAL NOTE: DWI 2.0's skins require a file called 'dwi2-skin.cfg' to work.  This is done
              to avoid accidentally choosing an old skin.
              The Sounds folder is very similar, but with new samples for some things.  Users
              upgrading from 1.7 and lower should run 'convert.bat', which does the following:
                 1) copy all files from \eval\S to \eval\SS
                 2) rename \eval\SS \eval\AA
                 3) rename \eval\SSS \eval\AAA
                 4) remove \eval\S
                 5) move all files from \select\song to \start\ready
                 6) remove \select\song.  (You can also delete \select\new)

v1.70.0 - June 17, 2002.
          - New method for creating Nonstop Mode courses - introduction of "CRS" file format.
            This should allow for easier creation of Nonstop Mode courses.  See below for details.
          - Removed all old Nonstop-mode sections.
          - New Nonstop Course selection screen.  Banners can be given to a course.  Also allows for 
            playing defined courses in different modes.
          - Two people can play Nonstop mode courses at the same time.
          - Better record keeping for Nonstop mode courses.
          - Style Select Screen modified.  SOLO mode is now selected by pressing up/down there.
          - New "Failed" sequence - arrows stop and fade out now instead of still scrolling.
          - Freeze arrow behavior tweaked.
          - Combo system can be chosen in Options Screen.
          - New command line argument "/sdevice:x" can tell DWI what sound device to use.
            (view dance.log to see a listing of available devices first).

v1.65.5 - June 7, 2002.
          - Added sound effect for when you lose a life in Nonstop "Combo" mode.
          - Updated freeze arrows to behave more like MAX.
          - Freeze-arrows don't do as much damage as they used to. ;)
          - MAX-like combo system.

v1.65.0 - May 26, 2002.
          - Added random background animations.  Put looping AVIs into ./Movies/Random
            and DWI will use them automatically in the backgrounds for songs with 
            no background script.
          - Random animations can be enabled/disabled in the System Options.
          - Addition of four new tags to DWI files:
             #RANDSEED:x;     - provide a number that will influence what AVIs DWI picks.
                                Will be the same animation each time if AVI filenames and count
                                doesn't change (default is random each time).
             #RANDSTART:x;    - tells DWI what beat to start the animations on.  Default is 32.
             #RANDFOLDER:...; - tells DWI to look in another folder when choosing AVIs, 
                                allowing 'themed' folders.
             #RANDLIST:...;   - a list of comma-separated filenames to use in the folder.

          - Ability to tweak timings for judging Perfect, Great, etc. steps in System Options.
          - New "Select Style" interface added (default now for "DWI (Second Interface)" skin).
            Use "SelectStyle=2" under "[GENERAL]" in the 'dwi-skin.cfg' file to enable.
          - Crowd cheers or moans during gameplay based on performance.
          - Music loop added to "Select Style" screens.
          - Routine for displaying background animations put into separate thread now.
          - New command-line argument: '/priority:x' can force DWI to run as a more "important"
            program under Windows.  "1" starts it as "ABOVE NORMAL", "2" is "TIME CRITICAL".  May
            improve performance in certain cases.
          - BUGFIX: Selecting an SMANIAC song after a previous one in 1st Interface fixed.
          - Other various bugfixes that I can't remember. ;)

v1.62.3 - May 6, 2002.
          - Minor bug fixes.  Main change is a tweak to the /test: command line arguments to 
            accommodate folders on other drives to faciliate step-file creator authors.

v1.62.2 - April 18, 2002.
          - Speed of song can now be set to faster than normal play using F3/F4 during gameplay or 
            at song select screen (1..5..9).
          - bug fix: BPM shift won't reset background animation.
          - bug fix: GAP adjustment should behave better now.
          - More developer functions added:
              /startat:<TIME>  - jumps to a given time into the song (game-time).
              /tick:1          - turns the assist click on at startup (default is off now).

              During play: F1 restarts song from the beginning.
                           F2 restarts song from time specified in /startat: option (if given).

v1.62.0 - April 10, 2002.
          - Can now adjust speed of song with use of F3/F4 during gameplay or at song select screen
            (useful for training).
          - Developer/Test mode added - using command line arguments, DWI creators can jump right 
            into testing a song they're working on.
              /test:...   - starts DWI in test mode.  See below for format.
              /p2         - test using player 2's controls instead.
              /speed:...  - starts song at a given speed (1..5)
              /scroll:... = starts song with given speed modifier (0.5, 0.75, 1.5, 2, 3, etc.)

v1.61 - April 5, 2002.
        - Individual comments for "100, 200... 1000 combo" supported.
        - "Assist Click" now possible (press f12 during gameplay or on the song-select screen).
          Requires a fast computer to ensure all steps are caught (behaves similarly to "Auto Play")
        - "Adjust GAP" value possible using f9/f10 during gameplay.
        - "Adjust BPM" value possible using f5/f6 and f7/f8 during gameplay.
          (Does not save new GAP/BPM values, but value is displayed so file can be updated).
        - "/search" command line option added (to force DWI to rebuild its songlist on startup).
        - Uses latest version of BASS.dll for better compatability, faster MP3 decoding, etc.
        - Bug fix: problem with loading some DWI files (eg. V/Trick mode).
        - Bug fix: problem with large positive values for GAP and immobile arrows.

v1.60 - March 5, 2002.
        - Nonstop mode added.  Adds ability to create your own courses, including the options to
          choose random songs in a given difficulty range, with pre-defined modifiers or random ones.
          Can set a course to "Repeat", effectively giving Endless mode.  "Combo" mode gives you a 
          set number of lives that decreases each time anything less than a "Great" is made.
        - Cleaned up modifiers slightly - "Power Drop" and "Sudden Death" are now together.  Woo.

v1.51 - February 8, 2002.
        - New modifiers:
          x0.5, x0.75,
          Boost,
          Dark, 
          "Power Drop" (power starts at full and depletes only),
          "Sudden Death" (you have to maintain a full combo).
        - New sort method available in 2nd Interface (folders grouped like in alpha/artist modes),
          should be easier to move between folders now.
        - Records screen modified to display full titles, and columns added for SManiac modes.
        - No limit now on the total number of arrows in a DWI file (used to be 2048).
        - BUGFIX: Comments in .dwi files outside of step patterns.
        - BUGFIX: Player 1's arrows in Split/Unison Battle modes now behind text.
        - BUGFIX: SAMPLESTART and SAMPLELENGTH work in the 1st interface song select mode now.
        - BUGFIX: Left/Right reversed in 2nd Interface.

v1.50 - February 3, 2002.
        - PLEASE RUN 'convert.bat' ONCE BEFORE RUNNING DWI v1.50 IF YOU ARE UPGRADING.
          The directory structure has changed slightly, and what was once 'images' and 'soundfx' have
          been moved to be "Default" folders inside the 'Skins' and 'Sounds' (was 'alt-soundfx') folders.
          You can delete the 'old-images' folder.

        Changes:
        - New "2nd Interface" available for Song-select screen.  (Other interfaces for other screens 
          will be added later).
        - New sort methods available in either song-select screen:
             By folder/genre, Title (all music), Artist, Player's Best, BPM (2nd Interface only).
        - New records-keeping routines:
             - Records for Maniac and S-Maniac mode are kept separate.
             - Names for high scores can be given and are kept.
             - images displayed for grades on all screens now, rather than text (to match Skin).
        - Songs folder is scanned only once, so subsequent start-ups of DWI are much faster.  To
          find new songs/update song information, use the new "Rebuild Songlist" option.
        - Sounds (announcer or sound effects) can be .mp3 or .wav now.
        - Sounds during gameplay kept in memory to avoid disk access (smoother AVI playing which 
          relies on disk-access).
        - "Controller Configuration" replaced with "Keyboard Configuration" and "Gamepad Configuration",
          so either can be used (not one or the other).
        - #SAMPLESTART and #SAMPLELENGTH implemented in DWI files.
        - Comments in DWI files allowed (started with "//").
        - DirectX mode graphics fixes.
        - Various bug-fixes all round.

v1.27 - January 19, 2002.
        - DWI should work on Voodoo 3 cards (and hopefully others) in DirectX mode now.
          Graphics will take a hit as they can't do everything newer cards can do - in particular, 
          backgrounds and other large images will be blockier, and graphics that had alpha channels will
          lose some transparancy - but it will run in DirectX.
        - New flag in BACKGROUND section: "KEEPTIME", for AVI files.
        - Better/more efficient timekeeping in AVIs
        - fixed fade 'edges' on song start/end.
        - option "/anysize" added for DirectX mode.  
          Forces textures to be created in original sizes if your videocard can handle it (can improve speed)
        - proper 'fade in' for songs with positive "GAP" values.
        - fixed selection in some options menus.

v1.26 - January 15, 2002.
        - Fixed problems with Voodoo cards (at least, tested on a Voodoo 5 with the 'x3dfx' drivers).

v1.25 - January 13, 2002.
        - Alternate graphics engine implemented.  Choose the SDL-based graphics engine at startup by using 
          the command-line option "/sdl" (otherwise the default DirectX graphics engine is used).
        - Other command line arguments:
             /16bpp - forces a 16-bit graphics surface.  May speed things up on some computers.
             /32bpp - forces a 32-bit graphics surface.  Some cards might require this option.
             /hw    - (SDL only) attempts to load images in video hardware.  May fail on some hardware.
             /fullscreen - forces fullscreen mode.
             /window     - forces windowed mode.
        - MD5 checking on files.  If MD5 doesn't match, warning message is displayed.
        - Better treatment of songs with no music file associated with them (error message displayed)
        - OGG/Vorbis support.  (Can now use MP3,WAV, or OGG files)
        - Synchronization accross all sound cards should be improved now, latency accounted for.
        - BPM display at song select screen (ensure that dwi-7segments.png is in the 'images' folder).
        - Bugs and memory leaks (hopefully) fixed on song-select screen.

v1.20 - January 7, 2002.
          - DirectX graphics engine implemented.
            YOU MUST HAVE DIRECTX 8.1 INSTALLED AND A VIDEO CARD THAT CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF 
            HARDWARE 3D GRAPHICS.  Version 1.05 will work on most other systems although will
            run slower.
          - AVI file support for backgrounds.
          - BASS.dll upgraded to latest version.

v1.10 - December 31, 2001
          - Used SDL.dll for graphics.  Seemed fairly buggy. :P
          - You can now press 'escape' on the difficulty select screen to go back to the 
            'select song' screen.
          - Bugfix: announcer comments in Versus mode.

v1.05 - December 26, 2001
          - IMPORTANT NOTICE
            DWI has changed the directory structure for where step files and images go.
            The program will detect the old directory structure and make the changes for 
            you after displaying a notice screen.  For the automatic conversion to work, 
            the files in Backgrounds, Banners, and DWIs must NOT be "read-only".  You 
            can set the attributes of the files by selecting them in Explorer and going 
            to File-Properties.  More details are in the "Using and Configuring DWI" 
            section below.
          - fixed bug in "Sort by Genre".

v1.04 - December 22, 2001 (pm)
          - Expanded support for different audio sets, similar to skins.
            The directory for new sets is "alt-soundfx", and each set goes in its
            own subdirectory with that.  The layout of the sound-set directories 
            should be the same tree structure as "soundfx".

v1.03 - December 22, 2001
          - Built-in support for skins, selectable from the options screen.
            Simply create a directory called "skins" in the same folder as "DWI.exe",
            then create different sub-directories within that for each skin you 
            wish to use.

v1.02 - December 21, 2001
          - stealth mode arrows now appear if missed
          - arrows rated 'good' continue to scroll up
          - new features added to Game Options screen:
               - Max Stage "Unlimited".  This effectively allows "Event Mode" - there is no limit
                 to the number of stages you can play, and the difficulty level is capped after you 
                 reach Stage 5.  Pressing "Escape" during gameplay will take you back to the 
                 song-select screen without having to go back to the main menu.  Failing a song 
                 takes you back to the song-select screen also, back at Stage 1.
               - Auto Play.  Will play the game for you, though you can still press the inputs if you
                 like.  NOTE: RECORDS WILL NOT BE KEPT when Auto Play mode is enabled.

v1.01 - December 16, 2001
          - minor fix to select screen, fixed crashing problems in Win2k and XP.

v1.00 - December 14, 2001
      - first public release.  Supported are:
          - BPM changes, pauses
          - Freeze arrows
          - Split/Unison/Couple modes
          - multiple folders
          - downwards-scrolling arrows
          - record keeping
          - background animations
