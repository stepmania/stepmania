StepMania 5.1 Changelog
________________________________________________________________________________
The StepMania 5.1 Changelog covers all changes that are in the 5.1 series of
releases.  All changes listed for the 5.0 series in Changelog_sm5.txt also
apply to the 5.1 series.
StepMania 5.1 and StepMania 5.0 have separate changelogs so that devs working
on the different branches don't have conflicts on the changelog file.
________________________________________________________________________________

2016/02/16
----------
* [ActorUtil] Added ActorUtil::MakeActorSet for turning a table of actors
  in a lua file into a vector of actors.  This should be used instead the
  logic in SWME that loads an ActorFrame, then strips out its children for
  the decorations layer.  The ActorFrame being stripped away in decorations
  trips up every themer the first time they learn it, so MakeActorSet was
  created so that problem doesn't exist in the NewField layer system.
  [kyzentun]
* [NewField] Removed NoteField board from NewField and replaced it with
  layers system.  Columns also have layers. [kyzentun]
* [NewSkin] Removed layers_above_notes and layers_below_notes fields and
  replaced them with layers field.  Draw order for layers in the column must
	be set in the noteskin now. [kyzentun]
  

2016/02/12
----------
* [CustomSpeedMods] Any theme still using the deprecated CustomSpeedMods
  system needs to be modified to add its load function to profile loading.
  [kyzentun]
* [Gameplay] Changed default theme to use newfield. [kyzentun]
* [item_scroller] Added item_scroller lua class as an alternative to
  ActorScroller. [kyzentun]
* [lua_config] Added lua config system for saving theme settings. [kyzentun]
* [nesty_options] Added nested options menu system for lua based menus.
  [kyzentun]
* [NewField] Changed functions in Scripts/02 NewField.lua to be inside the
  NewField class.  Added more NewField functions, documented in
  Docs/Themerdocs/5.1_incompatibilities/NewField.md. [kyzentun]
* [PlayerOptions] Changed PlayerOptions screen in default theme to use
  nesty options system to allow newskin parameter support. [kyzentun]
* [PlayerState] Added get_read_bpm lua function. [kyzentun]

2016/01/17
----------
* [TimingData] Fixed bug in handling of displayed beat lookup table that
  broke charts that had scroll segments but not other timing segments.
  [kyzentun]

2016/01/16
----------
* [NewSkin] Pump newskin by wolfman2000.  EasyV2 and ExactV2 by Jousway.
  EasyV2 and ExactV2 support dance, pump, and solo.

2016/01/14
----------
* [NewSkin] Removed routine newskin and put its player masks into the default
  newskin. [kyzentun]

2016/01/13
----------
* [NewSkin] Added anim_time and anim_uses_beats column fields for controlling
  how fast taps are animated. [kyzentun]

2016/01/12
----------
* [NewField] reverse_percent changed to reverse_scale to simplify code for
  flipping columns upside down. [kyzentun]

2016/01/08
----------
* [beat] Keysounds fixed. [ubuntor]

2015/11/01 to 2015/12/31
----------
* [NewSkin] Created noteskin parameter system which allows a skin to specify
  a lua table of parameters it takes.  The theme can then use the information
  in the noteskin to build a menu which allows the player to custom specific
  behaviors of the noteskin.  Noteskin parameters are saved to the profile,
  organized by noteskin name and stepstype. [kyzentun]
  Added explosion particles to default newskin.  Noteskin params control
  size, blending, amount, and distance. [kyzentun]
  Removed rotations table in favor of newskin actors being rotated by their
  InitCommand. [kyzentun]
* [Rage] Restructured major portions into Rage namespace instead of prefixing
  class names with Rage. [wolfman2000]
* [StdString.h] StdString removed and replaced with std::string. [wolfman2000]

2015/06/?? to 2015/10/27
----------
Various things done along the path to creating the NewField and related
systems.
* [Actor] get_mask_color and set_mask_color functions added for controlling
  colored mask.  Sprite is currently the only actor type that can have a
  mask texture. [kyzentun]
* [CubicSpline] Moved polygonal and looping solve logic to CubicSpline. [kyzentun]
* [GameManager] Added stepstype_is_multiplayer function.  Use this function
  instead of looking at the current style.  I'm hoping to remove styles in a
  future release. [kyzentun]
* [global.h] Added UNUSED macro.  This will be applied to things to get rid
  of unused variable warnings. [kyzentun]
* [LuaManager] Added convenience macros for setting enum members. [kyzentun]
  Moved FromStack function definitions so that the don't get separated from
  their declarations and drift out of sync.  (I thought I already did this
  once?) [kyzentun]
  Added rec_print_table C++ function for dumping a lua table to the log from
  the C++ side. [kyzentun]
  Added get_optional_double and get_optional_bool functions for fetching
  things from lua tables. [kyzentun]
* [NewField] New noteskin, notefield, and modifier system introduced.  See
  Docs/Themerdocs/5.1_incompatibilities folder for details. [kyzentun]
* [NoteData] Added SetOccuranceTimeForAllTaps so the time for every note
  isn't calculated every frame.  This probably belongs in NoteDataUtil, but I
  don't like it when a non-member function changes member values so
  intimately. [kyzentun]
  Also added count_notes_in_columns to later use for useless stats. [kyzentun]
* [NoteTypes] Added values to TapNote for the time in seconds that the note
  occurs at, ends at (holds), and was last held at (holds). [kyzentun]
* [Player] Changed how the field is rendered to give the field power over the
  skew modifier.  Both notefields currently exist in the Player, but only one
  is rendered.  The theme needs to use set_newfield_preferred until the old
  notefield is removed. [kyzentun]
* [PlayerOptions] Added NewSkin field and lua function because the field
  needs a skin when it's being initialized and there isn't yet an easier way
  for the theme to set that. [kyzentun]
* [Profile] Added get_preferred_noteskin, set_preferred_noteskin, and
  get_last_stepstype lua functions. [kyzentun]
  Added system for storing what NewSkin is used for each StepsType.
  Each StepsType has its own entry because NewSkins are not tied to game
  type, and hopefully StepsTypes won't be in the future.  Since a NewSkin
  picks what buttons to support, and doesn't have to support all StepsTypes,
  the profile needs to be able to pick a different NewSkin for each StepsType.
  When the profile plays a StepsType for the first time, the most used
  NewSkin is used. [kyzentun]
* [RageDisplay] Added Color key fragment shader for masking system.  Shader
  written by Yaniel. [kyzentun]
* [RageTexture] Changed frame rect calculation to do more work outside the
  loop. (neurotic efficiency obsession acted up one day) [kyzentun]
* [RageUtil] Moved unique_name function from XmlToLua to RageUtil so it can
  be used by ModValue. [kyzentun]
* [RageVector3] Added transform POD class for use by ModValue. [kyzentun]
* [SongManager] Fixed bug that made loading window progress bar not fill
  during the "Sanity checking songs..." phase. [kyzentun]
* [Sprite] Added mask texture system.  This was made for playerizing in
  NewField, but can be used on any sprite.  Set the "Mask" field the same way
  you would set the Texture field, or use set_mask lua function to set the
  mask texture.  When the mask is used, the mask_color will be applied using
  the alpha channel of the mask. [kyzentun]
* [StdString.h] Commented out body of sslwr function because apparently
  MakeLower doesn't exist.  wolfman2000 is killing StdString, so it shouldn't
  matter if this function is broken for a while. [kyzentun]
* [Steps] count_notes_in_columns lua function.
* [TimingData] Added lookup_requester_count so that PrepareLookup calls can
  be nested. [kyzentun]
  Added lookup table for the displayed beat for the NewField to use for
  scroll segment support. (or is this speed segment support?) [kyzentun]

2015/05/10 to 2015/10/27
----------
* Massive backend work to change the engine to use C++11 everywhere.
Rearranging of build system.  Reorganizing the file structure of the engine.
  [wolfman2000, prcuvu, teejusb, and others]
* Fill in more detail later if needed.
