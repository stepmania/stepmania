The following is a list of known issues with StepMania 5.

* Hidden, Sudden, Stealth, and RandomVanish do not work with layered
  note skins. Random Vanish, in particular, has caused crashes.
** In a more technical and general sense, diffuse commands do not
   work properly with ActorFrames.
* The course editor is not working completely.
* The scoring system needs to be made global for the game instead
  of tying it to the theme. Right now, this is causing a number
  of themes to have no score display during gameplay.
* The C and V keys in the editor (related to attacks) still has
  work to go. Crashes should hopefully be minimal if not otherwise
  nonexistant.
* Attacks involving noteskins do not work. They may never work
  again unless some internal coding issues are figured out.
* Routine mode (dance or pump) isn't perfect yet.
** In particular, routine mode and practice steps may crash.
* If two players play Oni mode, having one player fail causes a crash.
* The attempted new unlock code written a Preview or two ago
  does not seem to work at this time. Assistance may be needed here.
* Hold/Roll heads seem to be draw under preceding taps when they
  shouldn't be all the time.
* C-Mods have not been fully tested with all of the new segments yet.
* Split Timing needs adjustments with only one chart in place.
** Either that, or all tags must be allowable in song timing.
* Language detection fails for Czech and possibly other things on OS X
  (non-fatally, now)
* Japanese font maps are too large and get resized on load to something
  manageable. They should be cut into thirds vertically.
** This makes debug builds in particular load very slowly, and reduces
   quality.
* The editor sometimes keeps playing music and won't scroll.
* FFMPEG ruins our lives. I suspect init problems for Linux, since it
  works perfectly fine seemingly at random. Unsure for other platforms.
* VBR MP3's don't seek correctly in the editor, which botches sync.
* Strange TimingData-related crashes happen, particularly in ScreenHowToPlay.
