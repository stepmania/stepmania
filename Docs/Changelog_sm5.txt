================================================================================
StepMania 5.0 Preview 3 | 20110???
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2011/08/04
----------
* [NoteTypes, ScreenEdit] Removed artificial MAX_NOTES_PER_MEASURE limit. [AJ]

2011/08/02
----------
* [NotesSSC] Only write timing/attack tags for the step if there is a
  difference from the song. For timing tags, at this time it means that if even
  one tag is different, all tags are written. [Wolfman2000]

2011/08/01
----------
* [MusicWheel, RoomWheel] Moved the "- EMPTY -" string to the languages file. [AJ]

2011/07/31
----------
* [ScreenGameplay, LyricDisplay] Stop lyrics from animating on failure.
  Fixes issue 298. [AJ]

2011/07/30
----------
* [ProfileManager] Fix an issue when deleting recently created profiles. [AJ]
* Start removing anything related to Guitar mode. This was rushed in, and it
  is not worth us keeping at this time. [Wolfman2000]

2011/07/26
----------
* [ScreenEdit] Add a semi working implementation of the often requested
  copy/paste selected timing data feature. This should make it easier for
  some charters. [Wolfman2000]

2011/07/21
----------
* [BeginnerHelper] Removed DancePadAngle metric in favor of DancePadOnCommand.
  The same goes for PlayerAngle, dancer rotation is now handled in
  PlayerP1/2OnCommand. [AJ]
* [Course] Bumped up max edit course title length to 16 (still feels too short).
  Also added #DESCRIPTION tag and Course:GetDescription() Lua binding. [AJ]

2011/07/20
----------
* [Win32/CrashHandlerChild] Crashlog and log now open in the player's default
  text editor. Also, the Show Log button works again, including for people using
  Portable.ini. [AJ]

2011/07/19
----------
* [LoadingWindow] Added the ability for themes to have custom splash banners.
  (Currently Windows-only.) [AJ]

2011/07/17
----------
* [Cache] No longer store #NOTES in the cache. This should speed things up
  on the first load if there is not much to write. (General note: this was
  taken from another branch, but results at that point were great.)
  [Wolfman2000]

2011/07/13
----------
* [Difficulty] Allow ALL StepsTypes to use CustomDifficulty properly.
  There was some unfair targeting of Couple and Routine. [Wolfman2000]
* [Steps] Calculate accurate radar values for Couple charts. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenEdit] Display more accurate chart data for Couple and Routine charts
  for the future. No more having (almost) every row as a jump! [Wolfman2000]

2011/07/12
----------
* [OptionRowHandler] Add a new metric to ScreenOptionsMaster:
  StepsUseChartName. Use this if you want your charts to have a unique name
  in the options menu. If there is no #CHARTNAME or it is "Blank", it reverts
  to the original behavior. This metric is false by default. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenEdit] Fixed a bug involving #ATTACKS. Now when you set an attack,
  the mods are reverted back to how they were prior to the attack being set.
  [Wolfman2000]

2011/07/09
----------
* [NotesTheUsual] Update the #COMBOS tag to allow for a Miss Combo attribute.
  Any files that only use the Combo attribute will have that value copied to
  miss combo on next launch. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScoreKeeperNormal] Better match #COMBOS with eval. Scoring formulas should
  not be affected, but it may require more testing. [Wolfman2000]
* [Metrics] Have Pump mode lump the checkpoint judgments with Flawless and
  Miss judgments on eval. Of course, this goes down to Perfect and Miss if
  that is disabled. [Wolfman2000]

2011/07/07
----------
* [ScreenEdit] Fix the NoMines transformation bug, issue 363. [Wolfman2000]
* [CourseLoaderCRS] Don't load BEST# and WORST# where # is greater than the
  number of songs installed. Fixes issue 373. [AJ]
* [NotesAllSSC] Add the #CHARTNAME tag to the Steps. #DESCRIPTION is now for
  more detailed descriptions, or perhaps some short hand lingo. All files
  that used #DESCRIPTION will have their values moved to #CHARTNAME on
  load. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenEdit] Add a Steps Data menu for getting numerical step data on the
  chart. This is a read only menu. Edit Steps Information contains writable
  information. [Wolfman2000]
* [NotesAllSSC] Add the Steps version of #DISPLAYBPM. The Song version is
  still there, so themes should not have to worry about breakage.
  [Wolfman2000]

2011/07/06
----------
* [ScreenEdit] Fix the bug where hitting Enter during playing wouldn't take
  the user back to the editor. [Wolfman2000]
* [Gameplay] Fix Fail mods being dishonored. [Midiman]

2011/07/05
----------
* [ScreenEdit] Restore dance-couple and pump-couple for editing purposes.
  Saving should still work, but this was never tested yet. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenOptions] Mini is now ITG Mini, and Tiny is now Pump Pro Mini.
  This will prevent many prior courses from breaking. [sharksoda, Wolfman2000]
* [CharacterManager] Add a lua function to check how many characters you have.
  For an example of how this is used, check the default theme's scripts
  folder, specifically 03 ThemePrefs.lua. [Wolfman2000]

2011/07/04
----------
* [ScreenEdit] Add a function to switch the notes the routine players have to
  hit. In simple terms, Player 1's notes are now Player 2's and vice~versa.
  Check it out in the Alter Menu. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenEdit] Add two routine mirroring functions. Now you can build sections
  of a chart for one player, and mirror the effect for the other player when
  finished. For Pump players, it is not a straight mirror, but is more akin
  to what is found via normal routine charts. In other words, you'll be happy.
  Check it out in the Alter Menu. [Wolfman2000]

2011/07/03
----------
* [ScreenEdit] Fix a crash if one tries to remove an attack that doesn't
  exist at that time. [Wolfman2000]

================================================================================
StepMania 5.0 Preview 2 | 20110703
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2011/07/03
----------
* [Player] Bring mMods from OpenITG over. Also, a metric was added,
  "MModHighCap", to cap the speed mod if required for playing songs like
  Tsuhsuixamush. Set the metric to 0 or less to remove the cap. [AJ, sharksoda,
  Wolfman2000]

2011/07/02
----------
* [ScreenEdit] Fixed a crash when hitting Enter in the F1 help menu. [AJ]

2011/06/30
----------
* [NotesAll] Use #FIRSTSECOND, #LASTSECOND, and #LASTSECONDHINT instead of the
  former BEAT equivalents. Split Timing has made this a necessity thanks to
  certain files that abuse Stops/Delays more than usual. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenEdit] Add a function in the Area Menu to designate the current beat
  as the last second of the song. Please try to be smart and not use this too
  early. [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/28
----------
* [ScreenEdit] Add a function to copy/paste the TimingData of a player's
  choice. Remember to be in the appropriate mode when copying and pasting.
  By default, the song timing is already located in the clipboard, ready for
  use. [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/27
----------
* [Steps] Make sure #ATTACKS are copied when requested. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenEdit] Have Step Author up front instead of Chart Style. This is
  probably going to be better overall. [Wolfman2000]
* [TimingData] Preserve the length of time for Speed Segment scaling when using
  beats. [Wolfman2000]
* [NotesLoader/WriterSSC] #OFFSET is to be before #ATTACKS. This is required if
  we pursue beat based attacks and not just second based. [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/26
----------
* [UnlockManager] New metric: AutoLockEditSteps. Use this to hide bonus charts
  until the Expert steps are beaten. No guarantee that this works with no
  challenge steps in the song. This defaults to false. [Wolfman2000]
* [UnlockManager] New metric: SongsNotAdditional. Set to true to keep the
  default behavior, false to have the AdditionalSongs folder contain
  unlockable material. This is set to true to start. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenEdit] Allow jumping between all segments, not just Label segments.
  You still use Ctrl + ,/. to jump, but now you use Ctrl + N/M to cycle the
  segments. By default, it starts with Label. [Wolfman2000]
* [PlayerOptions] No longer display StepAttacks in the player's list.
  Instead, show NoAttacks if attacks are disabled. [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/24
----------
* [Actor] Implement compound(length,tweens) in _fallback/02 Actor.lua. [AJ]
* [UnlockManager] Add a new unlock reward: StepsType. This is similar to
  unlocking Steps, but it is targeted for one step in one stepstype rather
  than one step in all stepstypes. This needs testing. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenEdit] Add the option to convert delays to beats. Just find a better
  song to use this on besides Uprock. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenEdit] Fix a crash if you don't save any steps on a new song.
  [Wolfman2000]
* [NotesLoader/WriterSSC] Add support for Step #ATTACKS. Furthermore, Song
  Attacks (or rather, Step Attacks as it should be called now) are turned on
  by default instead of off. [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/19
----------
* [EditMenu] Allow all songs to work in Practice Mode, regardless of folder
  location. This fixes a crash if everyone had songs in AdditionalSongs.
  [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/17
----------
* [LifeMeterBattery] Fixed a bug where MinesSubtractLives was not being honored.
  Also added LifeChanged message to changing of life on holds. [AJ]

2011/06/15
----------
* [TimingData] Added many lua bindings for the other timing segments. GetWarps,
  GetCombos, GetTimeSignatures, GetTickcounts, GetFakes, GetScrolls, GetSpeeds.
  This should cover all of them now. [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/13
----------
* [InputHandler_DirectInput] Fixed MouseWheel input not resetting. [AJ]
* [ScreenTextEntry] Make it so only the keyboard's Enter key can finish the
  screen. Should fix issues with buttons whose secondary function is MenuStart. [AJ]
* [InputMapper] Modify default mappings. Use the Hyphen key instead of the
  Numlock key for Player 2's GAME_BUTTON_BACK. This should address some
  issues with Player 2 being unable to back out if they use a laptop.
  [Wolfman2000]
* [NoteDisplay] Add two new metrics.
 * DrawRollHeadForTapsOnSameRow: bool, similar to DrawHoldHeadForTapsOnSameRow
 * TapHoldRollOnRowMeansHold: bool, true means hold and false means roll
 * No noteskins should require updating, as these were placed in common/common
   for ease of use. [Wolfman2000]
* [LifeMeterBattery] Added ChangeLives(int) Lua binding. [AJ]
* [LifeMeterBattery] Added DangerThreshold metric. [AJ]
* [LifeMeterBattery] Added some important metrics. [AJ]
 * MinScoreToKeepLife='TapNoteScore_*' - any score below this = loss of life.
 * SubtractLives=1 - how many lives are lost when going below MinScoreToKeepLife.
 * MinesSubtractLives=1 - how many lives are lost when hitting a mine.
 * HeldAddLives=0 - how many lives are gained when a hold is completed.
 * LetGoSubtractLives=1 - how many lives are lost on a dropped hold.

2011/06/12
----------
* [ScreenNetSelectMusic] Add PlayerOptionsScreen metric. [AJ]
* [ScreenEdit] Restore the old PageUp/PageDown behavior, added Control + 
  PageUp/PageDown to use recent time signature behavior. Laptop users, that
  includes you guys too: semicolon and apostrophe are still good. [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/11
----------
* [ScreenEdit] Allow setting the Music Preview via the Alter Menu. Just select
  your area, enter the menu, and choose "Designate as Music Preview". No more
  math calculations needed! [Wolfman2000]
* [SongUtil] Added GetPlayableSteps(Song) Lua binding. [AJ]
* [Steps] Allow 255 characters for all chart descriptions, including edits.
  We are no longer bound by In The Groove I think. [Wolfman2000]
* [Player] Add GetPlayerTimingData() Lua binding. [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/10
----------
* [ScreenEdit] Split the Area Menu into the Area Menu and Alter Menu. Use the
  "A" key to enter the Alter Menu when a selection of notes/rows are
  highlighted. Use the Enter key to enter the old Area Menu for the options that
  do not depend on selecting NoteData. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenEdit] Allow converting selections to Delays, Warps, or Fakes as well
  as Stops. Remember, use the Alter Menu for this. [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/09
----------
* [ScreenSyncOverlay] Ensure that F11 / F12 work with all charts due to Split
  Timing. [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/08
----------
* Any notes in a fake segment or warp segment are completely ignored for
  scoring purposes. Now you can get 100% on your warping goodness!
  [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/06
----------
* [PlayerOptions] Removed the ScoreDisplay mod choices. Use lua to make your
  own scoring formulas that work in reverse instead. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenGameplay] Fix an assist tick bug if there was no Player 1. Note that
  this changes the behavior slightly: it is the first enabled player, or
  master player, that gets the ticks now. A better solution will be looked at
  in the future. [Wolfman2000]
* [NoteDataUtil] Fix a radar issue involving hands. Unfortunately, this means
  yet another cache reload for accuracy purposes. [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/04
----------
* Changed default MusicWheelSwitchSpeed to 15 (was 10). [AJ]
* [AnnouncerManager] Fixed a bug where no announcers would be loaded. [AJ]
* Restored the UserPrefAutoSetStyle behavior. [Wolfman2000]
* [NotesLoaderSMA] Better way of identifying beats and seconds. [Wolfman2000]

================================================================================
StepMania 5.0 Preview 1a | 20110603
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2011/06/03
----------
* [LifeMeterBattery] Added LivesLeft param to LifeChanged message. [AJ]
* [Windows] Set up directories for pictures and app data in their proper
  location. [Henke]
* [NotesLoaderSM] Fix an Offset load bug. [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/02
----------
* [BPMDisplay] Added SetFromSteps Lua binding. [AJ]
* [ScreenDebugOverlay] Switch the R and T keys to be Volume Down and Up
  respectively. I have to admit, it makes more sense to have volume up be
  on the right instead of the left. [Wolfman2000]
* [SongManager] Make autogen courses have "Autogen" as the Scripter. [AJ]

2011/06/01
----------
* [TimingData] Added the HasScrollChanges lua binding. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenEdit] Fix Song Timing behaviors. [Wolfman2000]

2011/05/31
----------
* [Player] Added the BattleRaveMirror metric. This determines if Battle and
  Rave mode will have the two players with mirrored charts or not. By default,
  this is set to true, preserving the ITG style behavior. [Wolfman2000]
* [TimingData] Added the HasScrollChanges lua binding. [Wolfman2000]

================================================================================
StepMania 5.0 Preview 1 | 20110529
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2011/05/27
----------
* [ScreenEdit] Added the LoopOnChartEnd metric. Once you get to the end of
  the chart while playing it in the editor, this controls whether it loops and
  plays again, or simply stops. By default, this is true, replicating current
  behavior. Set to false to replicate older StepMania behavior. [Wolfman2000]

2011/05/26
----------
* [ScoreKeeperNormal] Added the MissComboIsPerRow metric. Similar to the
  ComboIsPerRow metric, this determines how much miss combo is earned on missing
  a row of notes. By default, this is true. Set to false to replicate Pump Pro
  behavior. [Wolfman2000]

2011/05/25
----------
* [NotesLoaderSSC/NotesWriterSSC] Added the ScrollSegments. Think BPM change,
  but not. [theDtTvB]

2011/05/23
----------
* [Steps] Added the UsesSplitTiming Lua binding. [Wolfman2000]

2011/05/20
----------
* [CryptManager] Added SHA1File Lua binding. [AJ]

2011/05/19
----------
* [BPMDisplay] Add CourseCycleSpeed metric. [AJ]

2011/05/17
----------
* [NotesWriterSM] Write out OpenITG compatible SM files from here on out.
  This includes turning Warps into Negative Stops. For those that wanted
  negative BPMs specifically, my apologies, but stops are easier on math.
  [Wolfman2000]

2011/05/16
----------
* [ProfileManager] Added ProfileWasLoadedFromMemoryCard(PlayerNumber)
  Lua binding. [AJ]
* Added #FAKES to the SSC format. Similar to the fake arrows, these blocks
  prevent all judgments within the range. [Wolfman2000]
* Changed the syntax of #WARPS slightly. Now the second value is the relative
  distance that is skipped, not the absolute value when you start hitting
  arrows again. [Wolfman2000]

2011/05/15
----------
* [ScreenGameplay] Removed hardcoded commands for Debug (give up text) and
  replace them with DebugStartOnCommand, DebugBackOnCommand, and
  DebugTweenOffCommand. [AJ] 
* Added #SPEEDS to the SSC format. This multiplies your scrolling speed during
  gameplay, not replaces it (see mod attacks for replacing). [Wolfman2000]

2011/05/14
----------
* [ModIcon] Added StopWords metric. [AJ]
* [ScreenSelectMaster] Add "ScreenEmpty" param to MenuStartP# when the GameCommand
  doesn't set a screen. [AJ]
* [StepsDisplay] Added MeterFormatString metric. [AJ]
* [MusicWheel] Added ShowSectionsInBPMSort and ShowSectionsInLengthSort metrics. [AJ]
* [ScreenEvaluation] Stop the Bonus bars from overflowing in course modes. [AJ]
* [Banner] Added ScrollMode and ScrollSortOrder metrics. [AJ]

2011/05/13
----------
* Added Split Timing to .SSC files. All older .SSC files and other file
  formats are converted to split timing on cache load. We are no longer bound
  by Song Timing for everything. [theDtTvB, Wolfman2000, TeruFSX]

2011/05/11
----------
* [GameSoundManager] Added PlayAnnouncer Lua binding. [AJ]
* [AnnouncerManager] Add support for "gameplay combo #" for announcer. [AJ]

2011/05/10
----------
* [Sprite] Added SetSecondsIntoAnimation Lua binding. [AJ]
* [BPMDisplay] Added SetFromCourse Lua binding. [AJ]

2011/05/03
----------
* [ScreenEdit] Allow changing the Beat 0 Offset, Music Sample Start, and
  Music Sample Length via Edit Song Info menu. [Wolfman2000]

2011/05/02
----------
* [ScreenSelectMusic] Added NullScoreString metric. [AJ]

2011/04/17
--------
* Use lua for all primary score keeping. Course modes right now still use the
  old fashioned system. [TeruFSX, Wolfman2000]

2011/04/09
--------
* [Player] Force hold judgments to take place before setting the score.
  [theDtTvB]

2011/04/05
--------
* [NotesLoaderSSC, NotesWriterSSC] Add the #LABELS tag. This is meant for step
  editors to label different parts of their stepcharts. Use Control + , or . to
  jump to different labels made. [Wolfman2000]
