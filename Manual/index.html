<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>This is the basic player manual. We should also link to the Beginner's Guide
and Themer's Guide from here as well.</p>

<h3><a name="sysreqs">System Requirements</a></h2>
<p>sm-ssc can run on this bare minimum:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Operating System(s):
		<ul>
			<li>Windows® (2000, XP, Vista, Windows 7)</li>
			<li>Mac OS X (10.?)</li>
			<li>*NIX/POSIX-compliant OS (GNU/Linux, *BSD)</li>
			<li>Microsoft® Xbox® (<em><small>The Xbox build currently does not function.</small></em>)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>However, we highly recommend at least these settings for decent performance:</p>

<h3><a name="install">Installation</a></h2>
<p>If you're reading this, you've likely already figured out how to install sm-ssc.
Just in case you're reading this without having installed it yourself, however,
here are the installation instructions for various operating systems.</p>

<h4>Windows</h4>
<p>The Windows version is available as an .exe installer and a .zip/GameData.smzip
combination. The .exe installer is much easier to deal with, but in case it doesn't
work out for you, we have provided a zip file for manual installation. The zip
distribution can be converted into Portable mode by placing a blank Portable.ini
inside of the sm-ssc directory.</p>

<h4>Mac OS X</h4>
<p>The Mac version is distributed as a .dmg file; Mount it, make a sm-ssc folder
in Applications/, then put sm-ssc in there, and make folders as needed. That
probably isn't the best way to do it, but it is A way.</p>

<h4>Linux</h4>
<p>Linux users are typically expected to build from source. See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sm-ssc/wiki/Compiling">Compiling</a>
on the sm-ssc wiki for more information.</p>
